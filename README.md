# AngularJS Front-End Chat
----

I created this as a standalone chat application as it was more efficent for the initial demo build. I will eventually make this into a AngularJS module (and change the design for this purpose).
   
   
### Installation
You'll need npm, bower, and gulp in order to install and run this application.   
If you don't have node.js installed, download the install at: https://nodejs.org/en/download/   

To install the other libraries:   
`npm i -g bower gulp`   
   
Once you've installed them (or if you already have them), install the required packages:   
`npm install && bower install`  

Once that completes, you'll be ready to run the app. Here's the gulp commands you can use:   
   
   - `gulp watch` - starts the browser sync server
   - `gulp lint` - runs jslint
   - `gulp build` - compiles a build for prod


#### Commit 1
Basic structure of app. Runs but no design/functionality applied yet.
